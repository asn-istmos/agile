<h2>Istmos Agile-IoT</h2>
This repository contains the Istmos-Agile communication interfaces that should are used to connect to NB-IoT and LoRaWAN modules used in our Agile-IoT project.

The agile-iot framework language-agnostic, modular software and hardware gateway framework for the Internet of Things with support for protocol interoperability, device and data management, IoT application execution, trusted data sharing and external Cloud communication.

These interfaces are related to agile-stack repository and should be running as an addition to the whole stack, as a docker container along with the rest of agile-stack services running on the same gateway.
